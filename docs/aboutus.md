Kno.e.sis, Wright State University

Hussein is the lead researcher on the NSF funded project, “Social and Physical Sensing Enabled Decision Support for Disaster Management and Response” (HazardSEES). Currently, his research is focused on information extraction (IE) and NLP. He is the lead on the Location-related work and has authored the research paper titled “Location Name Extraction from Targeted Text Streams using Gazetteer-based Statistical Language Models.”

## Amir Hossein Yazdavar

Kno.e.sis, Wright State University

Amir is a researcher at Kno.e.sis Center Wright State University.  He is broadly interested in applying machine learning (incl. deep learning) and semantic web (incl. creation and use of knowledge graphs for social media analytics). He has a particular interest in studying people’s behavior, psychological status, social connectivity, and community demographics in social media.

Kno.e.sis, Wright State University

Prof. Thirunarayan has  offered several  tutorials on “Trust Networks” and “Semantics-empowered Big Data Processing”, and has many publications that span the areas to be covered in this tutorial including “Understanding City Traffic Dynamics Utilizing Sensor and Textual Observations”, and “Extracting city traffic events from social streams”. He is also a collaborator on several NSF and NIH funded projects covering social data analytics and applications spanning crisis management to health informatics.

## Amit Sheth

Kno.e.sis, Wright State University

Prof. Sheth has offered 30+ usually well-attended tutorials at some of the top conferences (e.g., WWW, VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE, ICWSM). His tutorial with his former PhD student at ICWSM 2013 on a topic relevant to ISCRAM “Crisis Mapping, Citizen Sensing and Social Media Analytics for Response Coordination” has over 52,000 views. He has led or is leading several significant NSF and NIH funded projects of relevance to this topic area (involving social media and/or crisis management/coordination: eg., “Social Media Enhanced Organizational Sensemaking in Emergency Response,” and “Hazards SEES: Social and Physical Sensing Enabled Decision Support for Disaster Management and Response,” with well over 50 publications). Technology from these projects have been used for coordination during real crisis (e.g., 2014 Kashmir Floods, 2014 Uttarakhand Floods) that have received major international media coverage, for comprehensive simulation for first responders in Dayton area, and for commercialization leading to Cognovi Labs started with the technology licensed from the university research he led.  Some of his 55 keynotes covered topics relevant to this tutorial. He is one of the top authors in Computer Science, WWW and Semantic Web.
