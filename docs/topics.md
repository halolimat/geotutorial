# TUTORIAL TOPICS

* Geo-context and Geosemantics:
  * Geospatial Semantics, Technologies, and Data Interoperability.
* Location Inference and Geocoding:
  * Top Down Approaches:
    * Employing knowledge-bases  (e.g., knowledge graphs, ontologies, gazetteers)
  * Bottom-up Approaches:
    * Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Statistical Models  (e.g., language modeling)
    * Deep/Machine Learning technologies  (e.g., LSTMs and CRF for sequence labeling)
  * Social Network Analysis
    * Community detection and graph analysis
* Applications:
  * Disaster-specific applicatons (e.g., Storm surge modeling, traffic-related modeling, rapid disaster response, disaster recovery, emergency management, crisis visualization)
  * Socio-cultural and demographic studies (e.g., post-disaster depression studies)
  * Location-aware services (e.g. recommender systems, opinion analysis)
* Hands-on Session:
  * During this session, we will demonstrate to the audience how machine learning can be used to extract location information and show illustrative examples highlighting the challenges and faults of some of the location extraction systems.
